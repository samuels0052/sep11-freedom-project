# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **Samuel Sharivker**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to independently study **Firebase** in order to help me make a **Grading App** with [Zi Xuan Yu](https://github.com/zixuany7791), and [Benjamin Chau](https://github.com/benjaminc8190).

## Implications
##### PROS
* Global
    * More schools would have access to a simple free grading application, which would improve efficacy and accessibility for schools to dedicate more time to students.
* Governments / Laws
    * Some governments might consider using our platform for their local education districts.
* Social
    * Students are able to freely communicate with one another about their grades thanks to our simple platform.
* Individual
    * Students are motivated to get high grades to access our built in reward games.
* Culture
    * We are creating a culture of students who want to have high grades, which will positively impact society since students are going to be learning more materials and studying harder.
##### CONS
* Environment / Infrastructure
    * Our project requires high performance servers to give the best user experience, which requires a lot of electrical power, which could negatively impact the environment depending on the energy system of the data center.
* Reationships
    * Adding new features and fixing bugs takes a lot of time, which causes the developers to lose their social lives and not be as free to hang out with their friends.
* Jobs / Economic
    * Our project is in direct competition with other grading platforms, which could put jobs at risk.
