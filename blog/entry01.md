### EDP:
I am currently in stages **1 and 2** of the engineering design process. I have defined the problem with my group members which is , **errors and bad features in modern grading apps**. We are researching what we like and dislike in grading apps, such as **Sync Grades**. We will continue to figure out what works and doesn't work to create the best app possible.

### Skill:

I have grown in the skills of **debugging** and **embracing failure** by working on this project. I have improved my debugging skills by helping out my classmates in class whenever they have issues with their code or are unable to complete a specific task. For example, while working on our **JS Project** I helped out the people near me by fixing syntax errors, explaining concepts, and refactoring code. I have gotten better at embracing failure because, while working on my **JS Project** I had to accept and overcome the fustraction of the **Google Photos API**. In addition, while working on my backup project, a **Pig Latin Translator**, I had several issues using the `useState` hook, so I had to read more documentation to fix my errors.
